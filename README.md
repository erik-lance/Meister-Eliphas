# Meister-Eliphas
Godot Strategy Portal Game for the 3rd UGJ Birthday Bash

Made this within the timeframe evident as per commits. Mostly made this for the Untitled Game Jam, but also submitting this to Gamedev.tv where I first learned how to program video games:)

Game was made out of inspiration of an old flash game I played called siegius. I did not have enough time to implement more units and abilities, but I was happy
enough to create a prototype I can work with in the future!:)

All assets are mine. If you want to use any of these just let me know!

Goal is destroy the enemy's base first!

## Controls

A/D move Camera
(Hold) Shift to move camera x2 speed
Spacebar to move camera to your own base


1 / 2 : Select/Deselect Slot
